# Container Block

The **Container** block enables you to group other blocks together inside a single wrapper section and is often used to contain, pad, and occasionally center the content within it. Generally, this block acts as a parent block that can hold multiple child blocks within it.

## Insert

In order to add the block, click on the **Inserter** `+` icon. Search for the **Container** block and click on it to add it to the post or page.

?> You can also type `/container` and hit enter in a new paragraph block to add one quickly.

After inserting a **Container** block, an inserter component or icon will be displayed to allow you to add new blocks inside that container block.

## Settings

Once you have inserted your container, you can customize its appearance using the **Inspector** panel in the editor sidebar:
